=head1 NAME

Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli - A Log::Dispatchouli specific wrapper for Log::Contextual

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<< C<Log::Dispatchouli>|Log::Dispatchouli >> doesn't need much to get it to work with L<< C<Log::Contextual>|Log::Contextual >> however,
it has one teeny annoying quirk in that its stack traces are always off by one.

Which has two primary side effects:

=over 4

=item 1. Under Log::Conextual, it shows errors coming from C<LC>, not C<LC>'s caller ( Useless )

=item 2. Under Moose, if you use a delegation, C<LD> will report problems comming from the delegate ( Useless )

=back

So this module exists to solve #2, and it has to solve #1 in the proces.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<router>

This is the only difference this module has from L<< C<Log::Contextual>|Log::Contextual >>,
and its that it returns a L<< C<Log::Contextual::Router::LogDispatchouli>|Log::Contextual::Router::LogDispatchouli >> instead of the default router.

=head1 USAGE

    use Log::Contextual::LogDispatchouli qw( set_logger );

    set_logger $ld;

Other than that, this module is just a wrapper around the rest of L<< C<Log::Contextual>|Log::Contextual >>
